    </ul>


    <h3>Group project</h3>

    Students working in groups of 3-4 people are expected to come up with an entrepreneurial idea driven by AI
    technology with a strong exploitation potential and explore its transformation into a business venture or a social
    enterprise. The teams are required to apply the 24 steps of the Disciplined Entrepreneurship methodology, to develop
    a strong
    business and technology development plan and prepare a final oral presentation to seek funding (Venture Capital
    pitch), which will be submitted for participation to the Student Innovators Competition SINN (see the
    <a href="http://c4e.org.cy/sinn2022/">SINN 2022</a> announcement for more information).

    Much of the learning in MAI622 comes from the shared experience of all groups. To this end:
    <ul>
        <li>All teams must regularly prepare <strong>mini slide decks</strong>, based on the work done to complete
            Disciplined Entrepreneurship worksheets,
            according to the assignments descriptions posted on Blackboard. These decks are to be uploaded through
            Blackboard.
        </li>
        <li>The decks will be graded and feedback will be provided on Blackboard or in-class.</li>
        <li>Further qualitative feedback may be provided via office hours or online.</li>
        <li>One or two teams will be <strong>randomly selected in each class to provide a 5-minute presentation of their
            deck</strong>.
            To gain the most value from the presentations, selected teams shall:
            <ol>
                <li>deliver a brief pitch of the business,</li>
                <li>briefly summarize how they approach the DE step at hand,</li>
                <li>indicate to the class what kind of feedback they are specifically seeking, and</li>
                <li>take note of the feedback and use it to further improve their work.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

    In addition to mini slide decks for in-class presentations, each team will submit <strong>several consolidated
    assignments</strong>,
    with their specifications and requirements announced through Blackboard throughout the semester. These deliverables
    function as a
    chance to update earlier steps based on feedback, preparation for the final presentation/deliverable, and as
    opportunities to obtain further feedback.
    The Group project comprise several deliverables that will be announced throughout the semester, and will include:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mission statement:</strong> A report on the mission statement of the envisioned company, which
            clarifies your purpose and planning.
        </li>
        <li>A completed <strong>Business Model Canvas</strong> demonstrating the main elements of the proposed business
            plan;
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mini slide decks</strong> that consolidate the main phases of DE’s 24 steps, along
            with <strong>Interim reports,</strong> comprising the completed DE24 worksheets for your
            term project, representing the outcome of your analysis as you follow the
            Disciplined Entrepreneurship Methodology, interacting with real customers, partners, providers etc to
            evaluate its
            business model. They should be submitted in the form of PDF files. The worksheets are available in the
            <a href="https://www.d-eship.com/articles/de-workbook-worksheets-now-available-in-digital-form/"
               target="_blank">Disciplined Entrepreneurship website</a> and you can also find them on Blackboard.
        </li>
        <li>A <strong>Financial analysis</strong>, including spreadsheet and explanatory slides;</li>
        <li><strong>Oral Presentation and final pitch deck:</strong> This is a "Venture Capital Pitch," to be presented in a 10-minutes
            oral presentation, followed by a Q&A session. The pitch should be prepared according to guidelines and
            best practices discussed in class and relevant readings. The presentation should be a self-contained
            document (often called a "deck") with no more than
            <emph>10-20 slides</emph>, which should be read-able
            if you email it to someone. The presentation is expected to be submitted and presented at the
            <strong>Student Innovators Competition SINN</strong>, organized by the University's
            <a href="http://c4e.org.cy/" target="_blank">Centre for Entrepreneurship</a>
            at the end of the spring semester (see the
            <a href="http://c4e.org.cy/sinn/" target="_blank">SINN</a> announcement for more information).
            All members of each team should participate in the presentation.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Final report:</strong> The final report should present a comprehensive summary of
            achievements. Its structure should comprise three sections:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Section 1:</strong> Updated Mission Statement and summary of findings.</li>
                <li><strong>Section 2:</strong> Business plan.</li>
                <li><strong>Section 3:</strong> Progress report describing (indicatively) product/service/business
                    development, market research, business model evaluation, prototype implementation, technology stack.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Section 4:</strong> Appendix with
                    completed <a
                            href="https://www.d-eship.com/articles/de-workbook-worksheets-now-available-in-digital-form/"
                            target="_blank">Disciplined
                        Entrepreneurship Worksheets</a>.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions and Advice</h3>

    <h4>Teams</h4>
    Group projects and their deliverables will be done by teams of students, where each team should have no less than
    three and no more than four participants.
    All team members will receive the same grade.<strong>Splitting or rearrangement of teams will not be accepted after
    the third week of classes</strong>,
    so make sure that you have in place from the beginning clear decision-making and conflict resolution processes.

    <h4>Grading</h4>
    Grading of writing assignments and presentations will be based on their clarity, reasoning, and
    depth, as described below:
    <p>
        <strong>Clarity (30 points)</strong> comes from clear writing, good structure, and meticulous editing of the
        text.
        The paper receives:
    <ul>
        <li>5 points, if writing quality is poor and careless, with no real structure in the text.</li>
        <li>20 points, if writing quality is good and the paper is logically structured. A few misspellings/grammar
            mistakes but not enough to be completely distracting.
        </li>
        <li>30 points, if writing quality is great, the structure/logic is very clear and enhances the arguments, the
            paper reads very well. Little to no grammar or misspelling mistakes.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Reasoning (30 points)</strong> is based on good arguments, which are typically established
    upon specific phrases or passages that support the claims given. Therefore, it is expected that arguments are
    properly
    substantiated with accurate references. The paper receives:
    <ul>
        <li>5 points, if arguments are weak and unfounded.</li>
        <li>15 points, if arguments are supported by a couple of examples but not enough to make a truly compelling
            argument.
        </li>
        <li>30 points, if arguments are supported by various specific examples. It is obvious the student put a lot of
            thought into constructing a solidly constructed argument.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Depth (40 points)</strong> means that the text contains original ideas and observations, and succeeds
    in teaching its readers something new. The paper receives:
    <ul>
        <li>5 points, if observations are very shallow and/or trivial.</li>
        <li>20 points, if the paper provides a mix of both shallow and more insightful observations.</li>
        <li>40 points, if the paper provides original and insightful observations, and the student teaches the reader
            something new.
        </li>
    </ul>
