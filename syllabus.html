        <h4>Group-project Work, Deliverables, and In-class Presentations</h4>
        <article>
        Semester-long, group projects are carried out by <strong>teams of 3-4 students</strong>  who are expected to develop an AI-related idea
            with a strong exploitation potential through a business venture or a social enterprise. The teams are required to undertake all necessary
            activities to develop a strong business plan by applying all the steps of  the <strong>Disciplined Entrepreneurship methodology</strong>,
            prepare a final oral presentation to seek funding (Venture Capital pitch), and present their pitch in class and at the
            <strong>C4E's Student Innovators Competition (SINN)</strong> and/or other competitions approved by the professor.
            <p>Group-project progress will be monitored continuously through the deliverables of assignments and peer
            evaluations, announced on Blackboard. Much of the learning in MAI622 comes from the shared experience of all groups. To this end:
            <ul>
                <li>All teams must regularly prepare <strong>mini slide decks</strong>, based on the work done to complete Disciplined Entrepreneurship worksheets,
                    according to the assignments descriptions posted on Blackboard. These decks are to be uploaded through Blackboard. </li>
                <li>The decks will be graded and feedback will be provided on Blackboard or in-class.</li>
                <li>Further qualitative feedback may be provided via office hours or online.</li>
                <li>One or two teams will be <strong>randomly selected in each class to provide a 5-minute presentation of their deck</strong>.
                    To gain the most value from the presentations, selected teams shall:
                    <ol>
                        <li>deliver a brief pitch of the business,</li>
                        <li>briefly summarize how they approach the DE step at hand,</li>
                        <li>indicate to the class what kind of feedback they are specifically seeking, and</li>
                        <li>take note of the feedback and use it to further improve their work.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            <li>In addition to mini slide decks for in-class presentations, each team will submit <strong>several consolidated assignments</strong>,
                with their specifications and requirements announced through Blackboard throughout the semester. These deliverables function as a
                chance to update earlier steps based on feedback, preparation for the final presentation/deliverable, and as opportunities to obtain further feedback.
                The assignments include:
                <ul>
                    <li>A <strong>Mission Statement</strong> describing the group-project idea;</li>
                    <li>A completed <strong>Business Model Canvas</strong> demonstrating the main elements of the proposed business plan;</li>
                    <li><strong>Pitch decks</strong> that consolidate the main phases of DE’s 24 steps;</li>
                    <li>A <strong>Financial analysis</strong>, including spreadsheet and explanatory slides;</li>
                    <li>A <strong>Final pitch deck</strong>, which will be prepared in <strong>two versions</strong>. One version will be
                        designed as a presentation for potential investors, while the other will cover all of DE’s steps.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        </dl>

        <h4>ECTS Analysis</h4>
        <article>
            One ECTS unit corresponds to <strong>25-30 hours of work undertaken by an average student</strong> to
            complete successfully expected learning outcomes. Consequently, the successful completion of the class
            requires a total of <strong>187.5-225 hours of work</strong>, on average. The workload of the average
            student is analysed as follows:
            <ol list-style-type="none">
                <li><strong>Class and Guest Seminar/Precept participation:</strong> 4 hours per week for 13 weeks, totalling to 52
                    hours.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Study at home:</strong> 2 hours per week for 14 weeks, totalling 28 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Case Study Report:</strong> 40 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Final presentation:</strong> 10 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Group project:</strong> 70 hours</li>
            </ol>
            Consequently, the total workload for successfully completing this course, is estimated to 205 hours on
            average.

        <h4>On Intellectual Property</h4>
        <article>
        The work completed in this course is intended solely for academic purposes. There is no requirement, explicit or implied, for
        class-formed teams to share intellectual property (IP) or equity in ventures that may develop from this course. Unless
        otherwise explicitly agreed upon with the course instructor, all marketing and business analyses produced are considered public domain.
        Students are responsible for ensuring that any technical intellectual property they bring into the course is appropriately
            protected prior to participation. This course does not provide mechanisms for IP protection, as its primary focus is on
            educational enrichment rather than functioning as an economic development agency or investment accelerator.
        It is important to distinguish technical IP from the knowledge and skills gained during the business planning process.
            Students are strongly encouraged to consult legal or patent professionals to safeguard their technical IP and take
            necessary precautions before engaging in disclosure or collaboration within the course.

        <h4>On the use of Artificial Intelligence Tools</h4>
        The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undergoing rapid developments. Generative Artificial Intelligence
        tools, such as ChatGPT/ChatPDF,
        allow the generation of written text, audio and images with highly realistic results. The University of Cyprus
        (UCY) is committed in the
        ethical and responsible use of AI based on specific principles for its utilization and on the appropriate
        preparedness of its staff and
        students. The following principles/recommendations regarding the utilization of AI in the educational process
        are in effect, starting in the Fall Semester 2023-2025 , and will be revised at regular time intervals.

        <h5>GENERAL CONTEXT OF USE</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>UCY encourages experimentation with available AI tools that aid the process of comprehension and
                learning,
                given that their use does not violate applicable ethical principles. It is noted that, AI tools must be
                utilised in combination
                with critical thinking, while also acknowledging their sometimes potentially serious weaknesses.
                Implementation of such
                practices, can potentially lead to the constructive enhancement of the teaching and learning process.
            </li>
            <li>Instructors may allow students to use AI tools in coursework assignments for the purpose of searching
                and cross-referencing information, to the extent that such use contributes to the achievement of the
                learning objectives.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>TRANSPARENCY AND QUALITY ASSURANCE</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>When AI tools are used in coursework assignments, students must explicitly and accurately declare any AI
                tools used and how these were utilized in the process.
            </li>
            <li> It is noted that the use of AI tools by students can contribute to the cultivation of critical thinking
                skills, through the evaluation of the quality of the assistance/responses generated by the AI tool(s).
            </li>
            <li>Specific instructions for the use of AI by students may be provided by the instructors as part of the
                course syllabus or as part of the written guidelines of a coursework assignment/examination, based on
                the unique characteristics of a course.
            </li>
            <li>Instructors are encouraged to adapt the assessment methods for coursework assignments/examinations in
                order to ensure the integrity of the assessment process (e.g., take-home exams and thesis assessments
                may be supplemented by an oral examination).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>ETHICAL USE AND ACCOUNTABILITY</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Verbatim copying from text generated by AI tools is prohibited. Instructors have the option of using
                plagiarism detection tools that recognize AI-generated text. It is
                noted, however, that plagiarism detection tools may have a margin of error. In the event of plagiarism,
                further disciplinary action may be taken in accordance with the
                <a href="https://applications.ucy.ac.cy/icons/ects/docs/General_rules_of_study.pdf" target="_blank">Undergraduate
                    Studies Rules (pages 35-43)</a> for undergraduate students and with the Postgraduate Studies Rules
                (pages 48-57) for
                <a href="https://www.ucy.ac.cy/graduateschool/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2023/08/kanones-dimosiefsimi-morfi-01.08.23-english-1.pdf"
                   target="_blank">postgraduate students</a>
                (Additional information on how students can recognize and avoid plagiarism in general, are provided in
                the electronic
                booklet guide of the University of Cyprus Library entitled "ACADEMIC PLAGIARISM: How to identify and
                avoid it”.)
            </li>
            <li>It is noted that AI tools should be utilized with great caution, with regards to the data submitted to
                them as input (personal or confidential data, copyrighted information, etc.) and to the results that
                arise from their use. It is also important to consider that, currently popular AI tools generate
                algorithmically-derived responses based on existing text which is available online, without confirmation
                of the accuracy and timeliness of these responses in comparison to valid scientific information sources.
            </li>
            <li>Users of AI tools are solely responsible for confirming the accuracy of data and ensuring unbiased and
                ethical conduct.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Other instructions</h4>
        <article>
            <ul>
                <li>Each student has the right to attend lectures and workshops without disturbance and
                    unjustified interruptions. So everyone is requested to preserve this right, respecting the start
                    and end time of the lectures and workshops, not disturbing the class, and preserving the cleanliness
                    of the auditoriums and laboratory spaces and in general the academic freedom.
                </li>
                <li>Plagiarism is strongly prohibited.
                </li>
                <li>You will not get any credit for late submissions. We will grant extensions only in the case of
                    illness (with a doctor's note) or extraordinary circumstances. Please let us know ahead of time if
                    illness or
                    an extraordinary circumstance will cause you to submit a writeup or paper late, then you should
                    discuss the
                    matter with your instructor as soon as possible.
