        <h4>ECTS Analysis</h4>
        <article>
            One ECTS unit corresponds to <strong>25-30 hours of work undertaken by an average student</strong> to
            complete successfully expected learning outcomes. Consequently, the successful completion of the class
            requires a total of <strong>187.5-225 hours of work</strong>, on average. The workload of the average
            student is analysed as follows:
            <ol list-style-type="none">
                <li><strong>Class and Recitation participation:</strong> 4 hours per week for 13 weeks, totalling to 52
                    hours.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Study at home:</strong> 2 hours per week for 14 weeks, totalling 28 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Case Study Report:</strong> 40 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Final presentation:</strong> 10 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Group project:</strong> 70 hours</li>
            </ol>
            Consequently, the total workload for successfully completing this course, is estimated to 205 hours on
            average.

        The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undergoing rapid developments. Generative Artificial Intelligence
        tools, such as ChatGPT/ChatPDF,
        allow the generation of written text, audio and images with highly realistic results. The University of Cyprus
        (UCY) is committed in the
        ethical and responsible use of AI based on specific principles for its utilization and on the appropriate
        preparedness of its staff and
        students. The following principles/recommendations regarding the utilization of AI in the educational process
        are in effect, starting in the Fall Semester 2023-2024, and will be revised at regular time intervals.

        <h5>GENERAL CONTEXT OF USE</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>UCY encourages experimentation with available AI tools that aid the process of comprehension and
                learning,
                given that their use does not violate applicable ethical principles. It is noted that, AI tools must be
                utilised in combination
                with critical thinking, while also acknowledging their sometimes potentially serious weaknesses.
                Implementation of such
                practices, can potentially lead to the constructive enhancement of the teaching and learning process.
            </li>
            <li>Instructors may allow students to use AI tools in coursework assignments for the purpose of searching
                and
                cross-referencing information, to the extent that such use contributes to the achievement of the
                learning objectives.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>TRANSPARENCY AND QUALITY ASSURANCE</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>When AI tools are used in coursework assignments, students must explicitly and accurately declare any AI
                tools used and how these were utilized in the process.
            </li>
            <li> It is noted that the use of AI tools by students can contribute to the cultivation of critical thinking
                skills, through the evaluation of the quality of the assistance/responses generated by the AI tool(s).
            </li>
            <li>Specific instructions for the use of AI by students may be provided by the instructors as part of the
                course syllabus or as part of the written guidelines of a coursework assignment/examination, based on
                the unique characteristics of a course.
            </li>
            <li>Instructors are encouraged to adapt the assessment methods for coursework assignments/examinations in
                order to ensure the integrity of the assessment process (e.g., take-home exams and thesis assessments
                may be supplemented by an oral examination).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>ETHICAL USE AND ACCOUNTABILITY</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Verbatim copying from text generated by AI tools is prohibited. Instructors have the option of using
                plagiarism detection tools that recognize AI-generated text. It is
                noted, however, that plagiarism detection tools may have a margin of error. In the event of plagiarism,
                further disciplinary action may be taken in accordance with the
                <a href="https://applications.ucy.ac.cy/icons/ects/docs/General_rules_of_study.pdf" target="_blank">Undergraduate
                    Studies Rules (pages 35-43)</a> for undergraduate students and with the Postgraduate Studies Rules
                (pages 48-57) for
                <a href="https://www.ucy.ac.cy/graduateschool/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2023/08/kanones-dimosiefsimi-morfi-01.08.23-english-1.pdf"
                   target="_blank">postgraduate students</a>
                (Additional information on how students can recognize and avoid plagiarism in general, are provided in
                the electronic
                booklet guide of the University of Cyprus Library entitled "ACADEMIC PLAGIARISM: How to identify and
                avoid it”.)
            </li>
            <li>It is noted that AI tools should be utilized with great caution, with regards to the data submitted to
                them as input (personal or confidential data, copyrighted information, etc.) and to the results that
                arise from their use. It is also important to consider that, currently popular AI tools generate
                algorithmically-derived responses based on existing text which is available online, without confirmation
                of the accuracy and timeliness of these responses in comparison to valid scientific information sources.
            </li>
            <li>Users of AI tools are solely responsible for confirming the accuracy of data and ensuring unbiased and
                ethical conduct.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Other instructions</h4>
